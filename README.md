# BottMedical_Microbiome
Simulating oral microbiome using MESA framework in Python

File Description:

- Batch_runs_convolution: a folder containing a csv file (created using Code in Play_around) with data from running a batch of simulations with different starting parameters
- **Bottmedical_Microbiome_Project_Report_and_Manual: final report and manual**
- Data_Analysis: Jupyter Notebook used for the data analysis part
- Final Results: the final presentation, a more visual representation of the Report
- Model Reference Paper: paper from which multiple concepts were adopted
-  **Model_Ilya_Final: script with the agents and models**
- *Model_Ilya_Final_Mutants_Extension: same script as in Model_Ilya_Final, but has various mutants for the prey as well as an option for random perturbation with antibiotics*
- Play_around: Jupyter Notebook to develop extensions for the model and run batch simulations. Mainly used for checking new concepts and looking for mistakes
- Run_Server: launches the selected server for the browser
- Server_Setup_Final: has server specifications for running Model_Ilya_Final
- Server_Setup_Final_Mutant_Extensions: has server specifications for running Model_Ilya_Final_Mutants_Extension
